=====================================

ARMR  is  a  privacy-centric  cryptocurrency  that  implements  Stealth Proof  of  Stake  (SPoS)  and  utilizes  the  TOR  protocol.  It  is  natively  integrated  within  the  TOR  network  ensuring  anonymity  by  concealing the  wallet  node  identity  and  their  digital  footprint  from  surveillance and  traffic  analysis  which  is  achieved  by  separating  identification  and routing.  It  is  an implementation  of  onion  routing,  that  encrypts  and then  randomly  bounces  communications  through  a  network  of  relays around the globe. 
Driven  by  a  primary  purpose  of  protecting  an  individual’s  identity  and privacy  online,  we  know  we  must  go  the  extra  mile  by  creating  an anonymous,  secure,  scalable,  instantaneous  and  untraceable  payment platform. ARMR  promotes  privacy  and  anonymity  by  default  for  cryptocurrency users  by  significantly  reducing  the  likelihood  of  identification  by  third parties  through  the  incorporation  of  industry-leading  cryptographic standards,  backed  by  proprietary  algorithms  and  anonymity-centric networking protocols.We employ state of the art technologies, such as Stealth Staking and Chainmail  Transactions  to  obfuscate  transactions,  making  it  impossible  to  trace  coin  movement  across  the  ARMR  network.  This  provides a  secure,  anonymous  platform,  operating  over  a  secure,  anonymous network  in  which  users  can  transfer  their  wealth,  free  from  observation and scrutiny.
